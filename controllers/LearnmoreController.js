      text: "Ad frame is an advertising platform built on D Frame, to help clients target users better. Through advanced functionalities like real time target audience analytics with matching interests and a general willingness to watch ads from the users, we hope for significantly higher Click Through Rates (CTR) through AD-frame.

Ad-frame would benefit from overall user growth of the D frame data ecosystem.",
